            <p>Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy 
                novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. 
                The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard,
                 Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger 
                 and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at
                  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                  The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict 
                  with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends 
                  to become immortal, overthrow the wizard 
                  governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, 
                  and subjugate all wizards and

            <li>Murder on the Orient Express</li>
            <img src="./images/Murder_on_the_Orient_Express.jpg">
            <p>The elegant train of the 1930s, the Orient
                 Express, is stopped by heavy snowfall. 
                 A murder is discovered, and Poirot's trip 
                 home to London from the Middle East is 
                 interrupted to solve the case. The opening 
                 chapters of the novel take place primarily 
                 in Istanbul. The rest of the novel takes place 
                 in Yugoslavia, with the train trapped between 
                 Vinkovci and Brod, in what is now northeastern 
                 Croatia.</p>

            <p>An Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago dreams 
                of a treasure while in a ruined church. He 
                consults a Gypsy fortune-teller about the meaning 
                of the recurring dream. The woman interprets it 
                as a prophecy, telling the boy that he will 
                discover a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids. </p>

            <li>Start With Why</li>
            <img src="./images/Start_With_Why.jpg">
            <p>The book starts with comparing the two main 
                ways to influence human behaviour: manipulation
                 and inspiration. Sinek argues that inspiration 
                 is the more powerful and sustainable of the two. 
                 The book primarily discusses the significance
                  of leadership and purpose to succeed in life 
                  and business. Sinek highlights the importance 
                  of taking the risk and going against the 
                  status-quo to find solutions to global problems. 
                  He believes leadership holds the key to inspiring a nation 
                  to come together and advance a common interest 
                  to make a nation, or the planet, a more
                   civilised place. He turns to 
                   Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, John F Kennedy, 
                   Steve Jobs and the entire Apple culture as 
                   examples of how a purpose can be created to
                    inspire a culture together, away from the
                     manipulative society we live in today. </p>

            <li>Angels and Demons</li>
            <img src="./images/AngelsAndDemons.jpg">
            <p>Angels & Demons is a 2000 bestselling 
                mystery-thriller novel written by American 
                author Dan Brown and published by Pocket Books
                 and then by Corgi Books. The novel introduces 
                 the character Robert Langdon, who recurs as 
                 the protagonist of Brown's subsequent novels. 
                 Angels & Demons shares many stylistic literary 
                 elements with its sequels, such as conspiracies 
                 of secret societies, a single-day time frame, 
                 and the Catholic Church. Ancient history, 
                 architecture, and symbology are also heavily 
                 referenced throughout the book.</p>

            <p> The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery thriller 
                novel by Dan Brown. It is Brown's second novel 
                to include the character Robert Langdon: the 
                first was his 2000 novel Angels & Demons. 
                The Da Vinci Code follows symbologist
                 Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu 
                 after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris 
                 causes them to become involved in a battle
                  between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over 
                  the possibility of Jesus Christ and 
                  Mary Magdalene having had a child together. </p>
